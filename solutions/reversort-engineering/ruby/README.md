# Reversort Engineering ⏪👨‍🔧

To run the program, in your console write:

```
ruby reversort_eng.rb
```

Then, it'll ask for the number of cases, in this case, **5** cases

```
5
```
Finally you'll introduce a couple of values separated by space, corresponding to `n`(size of the array) and `c` (desired cost) respectively. Next, is an example of the inputs and their respective outputs


| inputs        | sample outputs|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 4 6           | Case #1: 4 2 1 3|
| 2 1           |Case #2: 1 2|
| 7 12          |Case #3: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1|
| 7 2           |Case #4: IMPOSSIBLE|
| 2 1000        |Case #4: IMPOSSIBLE|
