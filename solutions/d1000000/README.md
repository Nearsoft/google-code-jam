# d1000000

## Problem
While the most typical type of dice have 6 sides, each of which shows a different integer 1 through 6, there are many games that use other types. In particular, a dk is a die with k sides, each of which shows a different integer 1 through k. 
A d6 is a typical die, a d4 has four sides, and a d1000000
has one million sides.

In this problem, we start with a collection of N dice. The i-th die is a dSi, that is, it has Si sides showing integers 1 through Si
. A straight of length ℓ starting at x is the list of integers x,x+1,…,x+(ℓ−1). We want to choose some of the dice (possibly all) and pick one number from each to form a straight. What is the longest straight we can form in this way?
