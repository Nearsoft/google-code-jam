# Foregone solution
Someone just won the Code Jam lottery, and we owe them **N** jamcoins! However, when we tried to print out an oversized check, we encountered a problem. The value of **N**, which is an integer, includes at least one digit that is a 4... and the 4 key on the keyboard of our oversized check printer is broken.

Fortunately, we have a workaround: we will send our winner two checks for positive integer amounts A and B, such that neither A nor B contains any digit that is a 4, and A + B = **N**. Please help us find any pair of values A and B that satisfy these conditions.
